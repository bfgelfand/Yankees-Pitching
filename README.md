# Yankees-Pitching-2022
## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/bfgelfand/Yankees-Pitching/blob/main/YankeesPitchingAnalysis.sql)

### Conclusions and/or Observations
1. The Yankees' pitchers threw a bit more pitches per at bat when they were the away team and when facing left handed batters.
2. When playing away, there was a relatively larger discrepancy in average pitches per at bat from lefty vs. righty pitchers against the following teams:
DET
LAA
MIL
NYM
PIT
TB
TEX



### Recommendations
1. Monitor pitchers more closely related to how long to keep them in the game when pitching at away stadiums or pitching against teams with more lefty batters. Think ahead to a plan for relief pitching.
2. If possible, you might want to try to adjust pitching rotations to match either a lefty or righty pitcher when away facing a specific team depending on which averages fewer pitches per at bat against that particular team.
