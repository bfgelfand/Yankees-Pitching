# Yankees-Pitching-2022
## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/bfgelfand/Yankees-Pitching/blob/main/YankeesPitchingAnalysis.sql)

### Conclusions and/or Observations
1. The Yankees' pitchers threw a bit more pitches per at bat when they were the away team and when facing left handed batters.


### Recommendations
1. Monitor pitchers more closely related to how long to keep them in the game when pitching at away stadiums or pitching against teams with more lefty batters. Think ahead to a plan for relief pitching.
