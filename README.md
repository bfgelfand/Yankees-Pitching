# Yankees-Pitching-2022
## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/bfgelfand/Yankees-Pitching/blob/main/YankeesPitchingAnalysis.sql)

### Conclusions and/or Observations
- The Yankees' pitchers threw a bit more pitches per at bat when they were the away team and when facing left handed batters.
- When playing away, there was a relatively larger discrepancy in average pitches per at bat from lefty vs. righty pitchers against the following teams:
DET
LAA
MIL
NYM
PIT
TB
TEX
- Throughout an at-bat, the Yankees' pitchers seemed to most frequently throw 4-seam fastballs. 
- Relief pitchers threw mostly off-speed pitches in the final pitch of at-bats, with the top two being sinkers and changeups. Starting pitchers threw 4-seam fastballs most frequently as the last pitch in at-bats.
- Home runs were most likely to come off of 4-seam fastballs.
- Both starting pitchers and relief pitchers threw home runs more often during early counts/early in an at-bat. 

### Recommendations
- This year, monitor pitchers more closely related to how long to keep them in the game when pitching at away stadiums or pitching against teams with more lefty batters. Think ahead to a plan for relief pitching.
- If possible, you might want to try to adjust pitching rotations to match either a lefty or righty pitcher when away facing a specific team depending on which averages fewer pitches per at bat against that particular team.
- If batters seem to catch on to the frequency of 4-seam fastballs, the team should change up their pitches more frequently. When pursuing new pitchers to add to the team, they may want to consider pitchers who specialize in some other types of pitches. However, if a pitcher specializes in the 4-seam fastball, pitches it well, and is successful the majority of the time, than its frequency of use should continue in those circumstances.
- If a pitcher's 4-seam fastball does not seem to be "on" during a particular game, call for other pitches within the pitcher's repertoire. Do not throw 4-seam fastballs as often to batters who hit a lot of home runs. Avoid throwing too many 4-seam fastballs if there are runners on base.
